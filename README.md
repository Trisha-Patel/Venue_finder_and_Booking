# Venue_finder_and_Booking


The Venue Finder & Booking  project is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of discovering, comparing, and booking venues for various events and occasions. With the increasing demand for event planning and management, there arises a need for a centralized platform that efficiently connects event organizers with suitable venues.

This project leverages modern web technologies, including Node.js for backend development, React.js for frontend user interfaces and Mongo-DB for database management to create seamless and intuitive user experience. The system aggregates information from a diverse range of venues, including hotels, conference centers, banquet halls, and outdoor spaces, providing users with a comprehensive selection and reservation process.
